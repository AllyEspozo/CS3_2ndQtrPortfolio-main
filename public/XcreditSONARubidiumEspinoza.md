# **Take on SONA July 2025 of Pres. Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.**
## by Alijah Lucas P. Espinoza from 9-Rubidium


### 1. **Give 2-4 key points from the SONA 2025 that you found interesting**
* The **₱20 per kilo rice** program has started in some provinces through KADIWA stores.

* Over **2.5 million homes have been electrified**, with solar expansion planned for another million.

* Every municipality now has **at least one doctor** serving its residents.

* The eGov app combines **over 40 government services** into one digital platform.

### 2. Give 1-3 key points from SONA 2025 that you found weird for any reason (explaining is optional)

* **Reviving the old *“Love Bus”*** as free transport feels like an odd throwback in a modern agenda.

* **Planting *100 million* hybrid coconut trees** sounds overly ambitious without a clear plan.

* The promise to **fix the *LTO license plate backlog*** in one year has been made too many times before.


### 3. Write 2 paragraphs of reflection (each paragraph is ideally around 4 sentences)

The 2025 SONA focused on **continuity, especially in infrastructure and digitalization**. Marcos Jr. wants to frame his administration as modern and forward-looking, with plans for roads, railways and national connectivity. It’s a **long-term vision with some ambitious goals**. But much of it sounded more like aspiration than actual progress. Many projects were started years ago and are still facing delays.

What stood out more were the gaps. The speech **avoided tough issues like poverty, corruption and human rights**. Marcos praised achievements but said little about what’s not working. He **ignored key concerns like the Maharlika Fund backlash and the state of press freedom**. The speech was polished and confident, but it left serious questions about how in touch the administration really is.


### 4. What 1 word/ phrase/ or sentence do you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025?

**"Promising, but proof is *overdue*."**
