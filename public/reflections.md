## 1. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with three to five sentences.

1. **Markdown**  
   I am confident with Markdown because I understand its syntax and how to use it for documentation. I can create headings, lists, links, images, blockquotes, and code blocks without difficulty. The in-class exercises and examples helped me practice writing organized and readable files. This makes it easy for me to create structured documents like portfolios or coding notes.

2. **Git, GitHub, and VSCode**  
   I know how to use Git for version control and GitHub for hosting repositories. I am comfortable creating commits, pushing changes, and managing branches. Using VSCode as my code editor is also easy because I can navigate files and run basic commands. These tools together help me efficiently manage my coding projects.

3. **JavaScript Variables**  
   I am confident with declaring variables using var, let, and const. I understand the rules for naming variables and the differences in scope between them. The exercises on variable declaration reinforced my understanding and made me comfortable with storing and manipulating data in JS programs.

4. **JavaScript Control Statements**  
   I can use if, else if, else, and switch statements effectively. I understand how conditions are evaluated and how to structure logical flows in a program. Exercises like the “Hola” and “Weird Condition” graded tasks helped me apply these concepts in practical scenarios, which strengthened my confidence.

5. **Loops in JavaScript**  
   I am comfortable with while, do..while, and for..in loops, including nested loops and using break or continue. The exercises and video tutorials helped me understand how to control repeated actions efficiently. I can predict loop behavior and implement it in projects without confusion.

## 2. List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but need further practice/discussion and why.  

1. **JavaScript Functions**  
   Why: I can declare functions and understand their output, but combining multiple functions in a larger program still confuses me.  

2. **Event Handlers**  
   Why: I understand the concept, but applying event-driven programming in interactive web pages needs more practice.  

3. **JavaScript Number Objects**  
   Why: I can describe them, but using built-in methods correctly in calculations requires additional exercises.  

4. **File Handling and Portfolio**  
   Why: I can start a code and organize files, but managing large files and linking content between files efficiently is challenging.  

5. **Debugging Codes**  
   Why: I understand how the code should work, but identifying and fixing errors in my programs still requires more practice.

## 3. Describe what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

1. **JavaScript Functions**  
   I will practice combining multiple functions in small programs and projects to get comfortable with calling functions and managing their outputs together.  

2. **Event Handlers**  
   I will create interactive web pages that use event-driven programming, such as buttons, input fields, and mouse events, to reinforce my understanding.  

3. **JavaScript Number Objects**  
   I will do exercises using Number object methods for calculations and conversions, and check the outputs to understand their correct usage.  

4. **File Handling and Portfolio**  
   I will organize my portfolio project files systematically, practice linking pages, and test loading files to improve my file management skills.  

5. **Debugging Codes**  
   I will intentionally introduce errors in my code and practice using console logs and debugging tools to identify and fix problems effectively.

## 4. In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think were not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why.

1. **Effective Activity 1: Q1 Graded Exercises**  
   Why: These exercises applied the concepts we learned, such as control statements and loops, in real scenarios, which helped me understand practical implementation.  

2. **Effective Activity 2: Video Lectures**  
   Why: Watching tutorials on JavaScript operations, loops, and functions helped me visualize how code works and reinforced in-class discussions.

3. **Not Effective Activity 1: Diagnostic Exams**  
   Why: While they tested knowledge, they did not provide detailed explanations or guidance on mistakes, which limited learning opportunities.

4. **Not Effective Activity 2: Watching Demonstrations Without Practice**  
   Why: Simply observing code demonstrations did not help me retain or apply concepts; for me, active coding is required for understanding.
